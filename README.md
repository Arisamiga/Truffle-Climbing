# Truffle Rock Climbing Embed
Repository for my Truffle-Hackathon Project

This is a submittion for the Truffle Hackathon

This is not a serious entry as it is mostly for use by the viewer rather than the streamer.

Basically, the Idea behind this is to have something for the viewer to pass the time when the "Streamer" is away or at a BRB screen. I think this can also be a part of the community of a streamer by using the customizing page to personalize it.
